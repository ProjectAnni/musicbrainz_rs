/// A recording is an entity in MusicBrainz which can be linked to tracks on releases. Each track

/// through copying or mastering. A recording itself is never produced solely through copying or
/// mastering.
/// Generally, the audio represented by a recording corresponds to the audio at a stage in the
/// production process before any final mastering but after any editing or mixing.
